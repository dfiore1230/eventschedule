# Testing Additions and Coverage Notes

## Summary
- Added dedicated unit tests for `App\Support\ColorUtils` to verify normalization, conversion, luminance, contrast, and color mixing behaviour, covering success paths and invalid input handling.
- Added integration tests for `App\Support\BrandingManager` to confirm that configuration values are normalised, fallback values are honoured, and storage disk URL resolution works as expected.

## Regression Coverage
- The new unit tests assert that `ColorUtils::bestContrastingColor` skips invalid candidates and clamps mix weights, preventing regressions where malformed colour data could break branding calculations.
- Integration tests guard the branding configuration pipeline to ensure future changes continue to respect localisation and storage defaults.

## Coverage Gaps & Recommendations
- Composer dependencies could not be installed in this environment because outbound connections to GitHub return proxy 403/timeout errors. As a result, running `php artisan test` (or any PHPUnit suite) was not possible. Running the new tests requires completing `composer install` in an environment with GitHub access.
- Existing Laravel Dusk end-to-end suites remain unchanged. Executing them still requires the projectâ€™s documented browser testing setup.
- Generating an updated coverage report is blocked for the same reason; rerun coverage locally once dependencies are installed to confirm overall metrics.

## Next Steps
1. Install PHP dependencies (`composer install`) in an environment with full network access.
2. Execute the PHPUnit test suite (`php artisan test`) and the Dusk browser tests as part of CI to validate the new coverage.
3. Revisit coverage reports after dependencies are restored to ensure critical paths remain tested.
